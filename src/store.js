      desc: `I am currently working on modifying a classic WoW server and client to implement some custom content.\n

        I have so far implemented new race/class combinations, as well as several custom spells.\n
        Some of my goals include restoring content cut from the original game.\n
        This is for: Mostly myself and friends.\n
        \n
        Why: For fun, and to learn how the systems I enjoy are created.`,
